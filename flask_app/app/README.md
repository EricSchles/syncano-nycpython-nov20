#Directory of Friends

A simple example flask app - incorporating the major features of the framework.

##How I thought about making this application:

###First iteration:
-Setting up the front end
 -Routing
 -View functions
 -Static files
 -Rendering Templates
 -Redirects and Errors
 -message flashing
-Setting up the back end
 -Setting up a database
 -Sending data to the backend
 -Accessing Request Data
 -About responses
 -Sessions
 -logging
###Second iteration:
-Adding pictures
 -Storing pictures in a database
 -sending pictures to the front end
 -styling pictures
###Third iteration:
-Adding search by exact name
 -Setting up the search bar
 -setting up simple search
 -testing and verification
###Fourth iteration:
-Improving search by adding full text search
 -installing the necessary extensions
 -introduction to regex
 -writing our backend functions
 -connecting to the front end
 -test and verification
